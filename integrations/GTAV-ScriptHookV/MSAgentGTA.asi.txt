MSAgent-AI GTA V Integration - Pre-compiled ASI
================================================

This file is a PLACEHOLDER for the compiled MSAgentGTA.asi file.

IMPORTANT: To use this integration, you must build the ASI file yourself:

Building Instructions:
======================

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 or later with C++ development tools

2. Download ScriptHook V SDK from:
   http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/

3. Extract the SDK and copy files to this project:
   - Copy SDK/inc/* to integrations/GTAV-ScriptHookV/inc/
   - Copy SDK/lib/ScriptHookV.lib to integrations/GTAV-ScriptHookV/lib/

4. Open integrations/GTAV-ScriptHookV/MSAgentGTA.sln in Visual Studio

5. Build the solution in Release x86 configuration
   (Build > Build Solution or press Ctrl+Shift+B)

6. The compiled ASI will be in: integrations/GTAV-ScriptHookV/Release/MSAgentGTA.asi

7. Copy the MSAgentGTA.asi file to your GTA V directory (same folder as GTA5.exe)

Installation:
=============

After building:
1. Copy MSAgentGTA.asi to your GTA V directory
2. Install ScriptHook V runtime (ScriptHookV.dll and dinput8.dll) in GTA V directory
3. Launch MSAgent-AI application first
4. Launch GTA V
5. Press [ (left bracket) in-game to open the menu

For detailed instructions, see README.md in this folder.

Note: This placeholder file exists because:
- The ScriptHook V SDK cannot be automatically downloaded in CI environments
- The SDK cannot be redistributed with this project
- Each user needs to build with their own copy of the SDK

The build process takes about 30 seconds once the SDK is set up.
